## What is YaTTa!?

**YaTTa!** (_formally Yet Another Talk To AI app_) is a hybrid software (both client and web) that allows interaction
with
an LLM (currently OpenAI).

It was born as a study project to experiment with some new technologies in the world of PHP (
specifically [NativePHP](https://nativephp.com/) and
[Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com/) v3) while the whole thing is supported
by [Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Here are some strengths that I think you will share:

- It is written in the language of the lambo-driving gods.
- Black is elegant and with pink is even cooler. _Hi Barbie!_
- I can fill up my commit history and do the perfect

Jokes aside (but not much), I hope this project will be useful for those who want to experiment with all the cool things
that are coming out these days.

## What is it not?

**YaTTa! it is NOT** (or wants to be):

- _Yet another_ new super badass definitive client that will make ChatGPT, Bard and the like cry
- _Yet another_ ChatGPT iframe shoved into Electron and passed off as software
- _Yet another_ perfect project with a thousand abstract classes

It should be clear that YaTTa! began as a personal, unpaid project, scheduled at indecent hours and days (perhaps after
12 hours of work). You will forgive me if it does not follow the state of the art but, being open-source, any
contribution is welcome :)
