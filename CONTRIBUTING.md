## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to YaTTa!.

Actually, the project is in a very early stage, so there are no guidelines yet. If you want to contribute, you can
open an issue or contact me directly.

Please open an issue first before submitting a pull request.

Please open Pull Requests with a clear list of what you've done. When you send a pull request, we will love you.

Please do not open PR with a lot of changes, open multiple PRs instead.

This document is too much potato, I know. I will update it as soon as possible.
